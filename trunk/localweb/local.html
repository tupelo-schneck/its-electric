            <b>Our electric usage:</b> 
            This graph shows the electric usage of Hypatia House, a home in suburban 
            <a href="http://www.charlottesville.org">Charlottesville VA</a> shared by
            <a href="http://tupelo-schneck.org">the Tupelo-Schneck family</a> and 
            the Downey/Rohdie family (of <a href="http://carpedonut.argon.org">Carpe Donut</a> fame).
            You can zoom in, and the graph will automatically reload at a higher
            resolution; you may have to be patient since we're serving this from home.
            The lines correspond to two different electric panels in the house.  
            MTU1 and MTU2 are most of the two panels; 
            MTU3 and MTU4 are an air conditioner and a heat pump.

            <b>The software:</b>
            The data comes from a <a href="http://www.theenergydetective.com">TED 5000</a> home energy
            monitoring system, and is presented using Robert's <span class="monospace">it's electric</span>
            software.  <span class="monospace">it's electric</span> runs on the home network, polling
            the TED 5000 for second-by-second data and storing it in a database, along with averages over
            longer time spans; it runs a server which provides the data according to 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/">the Google Visualization API</a>; and it
            includes this webpage to display the data interactively at various levels of resolution.
            <span class="monospace">it's electric</span> should also work with the TED Pro or the Current Cost.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Run your own:</b>
            Anyone with a TED 5000, TED Pro, or Current Cost who can run Java and a web server can
            <a href="http://its-electric.googlecode.com/files/its-electric-1.10.zip">download <span class="monospace">it's electric</span></a>
            and use it to store and view their own energy data, either for personal use or
            to share over the Web.  You can find an installation guide (and links to installation advice from various users)
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/its-electric/wiki/UserGuide">here</a>.

            <b>Discussion group:</b>
            I have created a Google Group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/its-electric-software">its-electric-software</a>
            for discussion, submission of bug reports and feature requests,
            publicizing your own <span class="monospace">it's electric</span>
            sites, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Developers wanted:</b>
            I have created an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/its-electric/"><span class="monospace">it's electric</span> project at Google Code</a>
            and would be delighted to have contributions from other developers.
