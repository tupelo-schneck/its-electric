Datasource server: better handling of DST.
Datasource server: options --record-time-zone, --serve-time-zone, and --ted-no-dst to allow different time zones for TED Gateway and for the served data.
(Can use this to turn off DST at the TED Gateway in order to have foolproof handling of DST.)
Datasource server: allow to have either only short (few seconds) imports and only long (full hour) imports.
Datasource server: --delete-until option to delete parts of the database.
Web page client: checkboxes to hide/show individual MTUs.
Web page client: try to eliminate memory leaks so a display can be left running indefinitely.
